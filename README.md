## About The Project

A modern, web-based implementation of the New York Times' Wordle game. This project features a clean, responsive design, intuitive keyboard interface, and comprehensive test coverage using Jest. Players can enjoy guessing a daily five-letter word with color-coded feedback, backed by robust code quality and testing practices.

### Features

#### Game Mechanics
* Five-letter word guessing
* Six attempts per game
* Color-coded feedback system
  * Green: Correct letter in correct position
  * Yellow: Correct letter in wrong position
  * Gray: Letter not in word
* Word definition hints
* Real-time game state tracking

#### User Interface
* Clean and modern design
* Responsive virtual keyboard
* Custom key widths and styling:
  * Return key: 110px width
  * Space key: 220px width
  * Functional backspace key (⌫)
  * Disabled special keys (▲, 123, ☺)
* Interactive tile animations
* Clear game status indicators

#### Technical Implementation
* Pure JavaScript without external dependencies
* Efficient game state management
* Modular code structure
* Fast loading and performance
* Cross-browser compatibility
* Comprehensive Jest test suite
* Test-driven development approach
* 100% core feature test coverage

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
* A text editor if you want to modify the code (VS Code recommended)
* Node.js and npm for running tests

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KenjaminButton/wordle-NYT.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd wordle-NYT
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Run tests
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```
5. Open index.html in your web browser
   ```sh
   open index.html
   ```

## Testing

The project uses Jest for comprehensive testing of all game functionality. The test suite covers:

### Game Setup Tests
- Board initialization
- Keyboard layout verification
- Initial state setup
- Word definition display

### Game Mechanics Tests
- Letter input validation
- Backspace functionality
- Word submission
- Color feedback accuracy
- Definition hint system

### Keyboard Interface Tests
- Key layout and styling
- Special key states (disabled/enabled)
- Key width specifications
- Input handling
- Touch event support

### UI Response Tests
- Tile animations
- Color updates
- Keyboard feedback
- Game state indicators
- Screen rotation handling

### Running Tests
```sh
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch
```

All tests are located in `ui.test.js` and use Jest's testing environment with jsdom for DOM manipulation.
